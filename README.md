## Revisiting Pure State Transformations Code

This repository includes all the scripts for obtaining the reported data and plots in [Revisiting Pure State Transformations with Zero Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04735).

### Julia Code

The Julia files are used for obtaining our lower bounds on the optimal fidelity in Fig. 5(a) of the paper. They are not written to be run from the command line, but rather from an IDE with a Julia extension, such as Visual Studio Code. All of them are effectively the same, but all are provided to avoid any reproducibility issues.

### Excel Spreadsheet

The excel spreadsheet contains all the lower bounds on optimal fidelity as well as the reported optimizing distributions generated from the Julia code that is reported in the paper.

### Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter notebook has all of the code used to generate Figures 4 and 5 of the paper.
